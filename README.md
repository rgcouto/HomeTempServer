# HomeTempServer

This repository contains source code to transform a Raspberry Pi (RPi) into a homemade temperature monitor and gives the possibility to access realtime temperatures via browser.

Connected to the RPi is a one-wire temperature sensor DS18B20 and one 4.7k Ohm resistor. The schematics to connect the temperature sensor to the RPi are as follows:
